-- EMERGENCY FIX for Daniel's Database Error
-- Quick and simple solution to get Daniel logged in immediately

-- Step 1: Disable RLS temporarily
SET LOCAL row_security = off;

-- Step 2: Delete any conflicting records
DELETE FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'daniel@hcqc.co.uk';
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'daniel@hcqc.co.uk';

-- Step 3: Ensure admin practice exists
INSERT INTO practices (id, name, email_domain, subscription_tier) VALUES 
('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'MyAi Admin Practice', 'myai.ad', 'premium')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 4: Create Daniel with matching IDs in both tables
DO $$
DECLARE
  daniel_id uuid := '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111';
  admin_practice_id uuid := '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
BEGIN
  -- Create in auth.users
  INSERT INTO auth.users (
    id,
    instance_id,
    email,
    encrypted_password,
    email_confirmed_at,
    created_at,
    updated_at,
    aud,
    role
  ) VALUES (
    daniel_id,
    '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid,
    'daniel@hcqc.co.uk',
    crypt('mJtXkqWmChC5', gen_salt('bf')),
    now(),
    now(),
    now(),
    'authenticated',
    'authenticated'
  );
  
  -- Create in public.users with same ID
  INSERT INTO users (id, practice_id, email, name, role)
  VALUES (
    daniel_id,
    admin_practice_id,
    'daniel@hcqc.co.uk',
    'Daniel (Super Admin)',
    'super_admin'
  );
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'Daniel created successfully with ID: %', daniel_id;
END $$;

-- Step 5: Make RLS policy more permissive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "super_admin_full_access_users" ON users;
CREATE POLICY "super_admin_full_access_users" ON users
  FOR ALL USING (
    -- Always allow access for super admins
    (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'super_admin'
    OR
    -- Allow self access
    id = auth.uid() 
    OR
    -- Allow during auth when no user record exists yet
    NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
    OR
    -- Regular role-based access
    (
      (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'manager') 
      AND practice_id = (SELECT practice_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
    )
  );

-- Step 6: Verification
SELECT 'EMERGENCY FIX COMPLETE' as status;

SELECT 
  'Daniel in auth.users:' as check_type,
  email,
  id,
  email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL as confirmed,
  encrypted_password IS NOT NULL as has_password
FROM auth.users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'daniel@hcqc.co.uk';

SELECT 
  'Daniel in public.users:' as check_type,
  email,
  id,
  role,
  name
FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'daniel@hcqc.co.uk';

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'daniel@hcqc.co.uk') = 
         (SELECT id FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'daniel@hcqc.co.uk')
    THEN 'SUCCESS: Daniel can now log in with both magic link and password'
    ELSE 'FAILED: Still have issues'
  END as final_result;

-- Reset RLS
RESET row_security;
